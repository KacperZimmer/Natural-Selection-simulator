# Natural Selection Simulation in C++ with [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib)

## Description

This program simulates the process of natural selection, where a population of organisms evolves based on their traits and the environment. Each organism is represented by a square with random position and color on the screen..

## Feature implementations

1. **Population Initialization**
   - Initialize the initial population of organisms. Randomize their position, color, and other traits.

2. **Fitness Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the fitness of each organism based on its traits and the environment.

3. **Selection and Reproduction**
   - Select organisms with the highest fitness for reproduction, potentially introducing mutations in offspring.

4. **Environment Interaction**
   - Simulate environmental factors that influence organism fitness, such as predation, competition, and resource availability.

5. **Visualization**
   - Visualize the population and its evolution over time using graphics provided by the Raylib library.

6. **Statistics and Analysis**
   - Track and analyze population dynamics, including changes in average fitness, genetic diversity, and population size over generations.

## Usage

The program can be compiled and executed using any C++ compiler with the Raylib library installed. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are included and linked during compilation.
